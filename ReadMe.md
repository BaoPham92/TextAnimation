As a recent graduate of General Assembly, I am currently cleaning up my portfolio, resume, project functionalities, etc.

I decided to make a nice text animation for the landing page. Definitely would say I almost ripped my brain up trying to figure out how to chain animations on the same element.

From 2 days of reading docs, experimenting, guides, incorrect code implementation due to keyframe timings, I finally made a texts animate using CSS3 Animate.

----------------------------------------------------------

checklist:

@Keyframes and properties excercises 1-6 from W3Schools.
<!-- Definitely helped. Amazing resource. -->

Amitable properties (2D) Transform (X,Y) and Opacity.
<!-- Core animation -->

learned nth-of-type giving keyframe animation ease of use.
<!-- Timing is always important when animating. -->

----------------------------------------------------------

/Notes?

- Very much enjoyable. Should stay away from the animation sugar. Losing track of time because "animations are fun" should not be a regular excuse haha.

- Starting to write ReadMe's more often.  Writing one's own craft and learning process is helpful in memory, and clarity for references.
